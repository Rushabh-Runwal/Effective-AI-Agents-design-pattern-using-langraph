## 📦 Repository Overview

In this assignment, I implemented **agent patterns** from the *Building Effective Agents* course using two major frameworks:
- ✅ [**LangGraph API** (with LangSmith Studio traces)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OSIQAKcUAAYUv7TVn4CBxDPH_NJDpGtj?usp=sharing)
- ✅ [**CrewAI**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qXGuM56noMI9QuT4Y1G8l8qzxIcrgJQF?usp=sharing)

For each framework, I:
- Created a dedicated Google Colab notebook.
- Demonstrated key agent workflows and patterns.
- Collected debug traces and outputs.
- Recorded a **video walkthrough** explaining the code, logic, and execution.

## 🚀 Colab Notebooks

### 1️⃣ [LangGraph API Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OSIQAKcUAAYUv7TVn4CBxDPH_NJDpGtj?usp=sharing)
- Implements core agent patterns using the **LangGraph API**.
- Demonstrates integration with **LangSmith Studio** for trace visualizations.
- Includes:
  - Agent setup and workflow design.
  - Debug traces and visual outputs.

### 2️⃣ [CrewAI-Based Agents Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qXGuM56noMI9QuT4Y1G8l8qzxIcrgJQF?usp=sharing)
- Reimplements the same patterns using **CrewAI**.
- Explores parallel and sequential agent workflows.
- Optionally integrates Grok or similar tools for enhanced execution.
